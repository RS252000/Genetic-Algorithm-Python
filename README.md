Study on the classic problem called the Stigler diet:

In this repository we perform a study on the classic problem called the Stigler diet, named for economics Nobel laureate George Stigler, who computed an inexpensive way to fulfill basic nutritional needs given a set of foods. He posed this as a mathematical exercise, not as eating recommendations, although the notion of computing optimal nutrition has of come into vogue recently.
